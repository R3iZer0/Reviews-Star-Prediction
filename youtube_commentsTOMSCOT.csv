"Don&#39;t worry, I didn&#39;t travel to New Jersey just for this; I was in the area and it seemed like an apt location. I did try to remove the truck-reversing sound near the end, but it just sounded worse: and given what I was talking about at the time, that also felt apt!",Tom Scott,22337
"Telling the audience that you&#39;re doing a thing to subtly manipulate them, and how and why it works, with no intent to stop because it DOES work, thus establishing trust by being forthright about a lie to establish trust is probably about the most Tom Scott thing ever.",Anthony Harris,37983
It&#39;s amazing how Tom manages to look like he&#39;s both in his 20&#39;s and in his 60&#39;s at the same time,T2and3,8023
"What I love is that he not only answers the question, but he does it in such a way I don&#39;t want to skip to the end.",Mara Jade,3941
"I have an auditory processing disorder. I noticed the lack of sync immediately, because of being so used to reading lips and searching for visual cues. Also, knowing Tom Scott, I was kinda expecting it to be unsynchronized on purpose. Very cool video.",Dorian,3293
"I love how the most replayed part is Tom talking about the 3 frames late, meaning most people decided to go back a few seconds to see if they can catch the 3-frame lag",4048 Antonio,440
Tom always impresses me with those incredibly long shots of him talking. I can&#39;t imagine how hard it is to not slip up for that long.,Hunter Morgan,216
"I get a weird uneasiness sometimes with poorly synced audio. I did this time, was actually noticing in real-time, and only realized why after you explaining and changing it back a few seconds later. Certainly confirmed a lot for me and possibly explained why at times I‚Äôll find a video I just find unsettling to watch for unapparent reasons.",J,723
"Honestly Tom you have been a standard of what youtube videos can be and how they should cater to their audience, thank you for all that you do.",alphabet is gay,166
"I must admit after hearing the truck sound and talking about setting the scene, I totally expected you to walk away and reveal it was a green screen afterall.",Jeff Ferguson,471
"In case some people don&#39;t catch the irony of showing the monument in the end of the video, in 1938 Orson Welles did a radio theater adaptation of H.G. Wells&#39; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;... except he didn&#39;t tell the audience at the beginning that it was just a theater show, so people across the country started panicking because they thought a real life alien invasion was underway. People at the time got much of their news from radio, and Welles created a show that used theatrical authenticity to exploit the audience&#39;s trust in radio as a news medium, while here, Tom is demonstrating how he uses theatrics to create authentic trust between himself and the viewer.",Jason Osmond,669
The three frame delay is so confusing to me because I felt something was off with the synchronization even before he said it but when actively trying to match the sound to the video I couldn‚Äôt see the delay at all.,Niklas Sander,239
"I respect the hell out of Tom every time he pulls a baller move like giving exactly the solution you&#39;re looking for within 10 seconds of the video starting, trusting you to be patient enough to wait through the rest just because you seek the pleasure of learning something",MysterySteve,9752
"We used to call this &quot;double-system sound&quot; in the 16mm film days. Much as Tom is doing here, we had a sound recorder separate from the camera, usually a Nagra or some other high-quality (ie, &quot;expensive&quot;) type. Sync was either with a cable connecting the camera and recorder or motors on both devices controlled by crystals that kept the speed constant. In post, we transferred the sound from 1/4-inch, reel-to-reel tapes to 16mm film that was coated with magnetic recording material. That way there was a frame-for-frame match between picture and sound. Of course, it took a lot of machinery to make this happen, and that&#39;s why movies with sound were beyond the range of most people. Thanks, Tom.",Bill Doorley,187
"you didn&#39;t mention an additional issue that we subconsciously correct during editing: our ears perceive sound faster than eyes perceive images, so a &quot;perfect&quot; sync on paper will still look weird, whereas if you delay the audio just by 1 or 2 frames, it will compensate the &quot;slowness&quot; of the eyes, and they will meet in the brain at the same time, resulting in a more natural synchronization. in short, each sense has its own delay times, hope this helps.",eyevenear,72
My new favorite thing that Tom does is answer the video title question we all read in our heads when the video starts. Its like he&#39;s answering our inner monologue.,Clay,37
"Thanks for clearing up why I feel vaguely insane for audio and lip syncing discrepancies (I wear HAs and heavily reliant on lip reading so I catch the spots where audios doesn‚Äôt quite match the video, but it hard to quantify so I just feel vaguely insane 90% of the times it happenüòÖ especially cause it doesn&#39;t bother all of my hearing friends less)",keyboardsmash,31
thank you for the clarification i finally understand myself fully,doddleoddle,2085
"6 seconds into the video and we already have our answer, other youtubers should look up to this guy",koshkamatew,346
&quot;I don&#39;t need to be relatable. I don&#39;t really want to be relatable.&quot; I have never heard Tom sum up so succinctly the difference between how he uses youtube and how most other youtubers use it.,AWadeLa,23
"Also, fun fact @Tom Scott, there is a slight delay when recording audio with an external microphone. You can test this by recording 10-20 minutes of audio and comparing it with the corresponding video. This delay is likely caused by the distance and conversions (such as Bluetooth) that the electronic signal needs to travel in order to reach the recording device. Unlike a camera, where the distance is shorter and the audio is more in sync.",Wanderlust Travel Videos,2
"I think it also helps draw more of the audiences focus. I notice that instead of just putting on an other video in the background and zoning out as I sometimes do, it grabs my full attention for a brief moment. Possibly getting me more invested in the video and separating it from what I was watching before.",apainintheaas,15
"Tom, your videos are great, so informative and explained in a why that anyone can understand, and you cover such a great range of topics, I love them!",Greg Bartholomew,8
"The wave to the crewmembers who may or may not have been there is an absolute masterpiece of subversion, creating just a tiny bit of doubt.",James Brixey,4730
"I see this in documentaries as well. Setting up, makes sense in that kind of production.<br><br>In my videos, I don‚Äôt really think ‚ÄúI want people to think I‚Äôm trustworthy!‚Äù Although I understand what it comes from. I find it to be more ‚Äúhis is how I got here‚Äù instead of plopping up from nothing or switching place all of a sudden. Not every time, but often I think of it more as a way to tell time and help with glueing the vlog or whatever together. <br><br>Interesting and well done, as usual!",viggo,12
"You are low key becoming my fav youtuber. Extremely precise, no crap, informative and interesting at the same time!",Gursheen Kaur,8
"As a professional videographer, I used to use some extra little recorders by a brsand called Evistr.  The sound quality was fantastic, like Pressure Zone mics out of what were tiny metal-bodied dictaphones with digital screens.  Problem was, they ran slightly slow of the rest of the equipment so I had to snip the wave on the timeline every so often and nudge everything back into time. You&#39;d think in this day and age, digital gear could at least count in time. These days I use the RODE Wireless Go2 radio mics.",Jon Dow - Aka DerbJD,0
"As a long time fan, I gotta say this is one of you best videos yet. Simple, quick and to the point, while also being very enlightening.<br><br>As always, thank you for your work Tom!",Lucas Reis,16
Would&#39;ve been so good if he actually was in his room using a green screen,m3g4t0nerr,76
I really appreciate how he gets straight to the point for people who are just curious then goes into all the details and stuff through the rest of the video,FWUTIG,4823
"Actually, even in film scoring or trailer music / sound design, big hits are just slightly behind explosions / cuts because it feels more realistic. As you explained, soundwaves need some time to travel but light does (almost) not. The brain does allow up to ~10ms of delay in sound before we mention that something is off. But every single millisecond of sound being ahead of light feels odd. Crazy, right?",Maximilian Bei√üel,4
"This was such a great video. Quick, interesting, informative, and it let us learn a bit more about you and how you approach making videos :)",ThisRandomDude,1
You can actually enable &quot;Show Time Units&quot; in Premiere to move audio tracks by samples instead of frames. I usually use this to sync the audio to the frame and nothing else after because nudging audio 4800/s is a royal pain in the ass. 100% precise every time.,ingaman,1
"Tom, thank you so much! These appear to be simple concepts, but really are much deeper than I knew.<br><br>This is all great stuff, thank you!",Neon Recording,3
The human connection point about behind-the-scenes is demonstrated really well in Joel Haver&#39;s videos. The slip-ups and smirks that he deliberately leaves in just make it all the more endearing.,ThatGuyCalledDai,5
"As I&#39;ve said for years: the best production value isn&#39;t always the <i>highest</i> production value. It depends on the audience, the message, and the format",Simon Clark,4267
&quot;I don&#39;t need to be relatable. I don&#39;t really...want to be relatable.&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br>I can relate to that. üò∂üòè,Hattie Lankford,3
"I can (usually) always notice when the audio is desynchronised from the video, and it gets really frustrating for me, often to the point that I can no longer watch. However, sometimes, the audio is so out of sync that it becomes fine again, like a couple of seconds.",smidge-J,6
"Haha I love the ending &quot;you can trust me...&quot; on a panning shot to the Martian landing plaque. Odd nobody else seems to have commented on that! I&#39;m guessing it has something to do with War of the Worlds?<br><br>Also, interesting to me, the audio you said was 3 frames late looked more natural to me than the audio when it was supposed to be exactly synchronised, even though it was quite a close shot and the delay due to speed of sound should have been about 1 frame.",Ranulf Doswell,16
I trust Tom Scott with my life because he claps at the beginning of his videos.,Vanasonic,10
"I heard it described once that if you didn&#39;t know about the discrepancy between the speed of sound and that of light then if you were watching a lumberjack work across the valley you might think that an axe was a device that makes a loud sound when held above the head. ü™µ<br>Edit: Also, an actual filmmaker&#39;s clapperboard not only makes a sharper peak in the audio, those chevrons on the clapper shows the exact moment when they touch allowing much finer synchronisation than with the hand technique.",Les Hemmings,4
"It&#39;s interesting because when I used to do some videos back in 2014 and 2015 I never considered clapping as this video editing helper, just like an introduction to the video, but I remember when editing it helped a lot, and later on in 2017 videos I stopped clapping and it made it more difficult to sync audio and video.",SuperGion915,1
"&quot;I don&#39;t want to be relatable, I want to be trustworthy&quot; - I think this is why we all love Tom.",Shawn Christopher,4179
"That answer was way deeper than I thought it should be. Perhaps many does it without consciously thinking about all these details, but to know that it works in a way so soft and subtle adds plenty of meaning to it",Aryasakti,5
I was just explaining this to my colleague the other week. I do webcasts and video recordings and noticed that audio out of sync isn&#39;t always bad or noticeable.<br>But if the audio is before the video people will notice and complain.<br>I figured it out that is actually normally how our brains perceive the world.<br>Since light travels faster than sound.,djones02,4
"I can attest that when I edit videos it feels &quot;wrong&quot; for the sound and visual to be exactly in sync, our brains definitely compensate subconciously for the speed of sound",Nathan Goedeke,1
I like the irony of telling us about making your audio trustworthy whilst standing on the spot where so many people were duped by a radio broadcast.,Rob Knight,5
"I know you&#39;ve probably heard it before but thank you so much for just answering the title immediately in your videos. Honestly its what gets me to stick around, because now I&#39;m more intrigued to know <i>why</i>",jowys,2

"Ok I am very glad you said that it was offset because I was actually feeling crazy. I felt like things were just slightly out of sync and really wasn&#39;t sure if it was intentional or just something I hadn&#39;t noticed till then. <br><br>Admittedly that is something I&#39;m hyper sensitive to, synchronization of audio, even slight desyncs make me feel sick to my stomach because it hurts my head seeing things not line up.",rednekdashie,0

"Tom might not make learning fun, but he does make it learnable. It&#39;s a rare thing, to be able to take a seemingly mundane,or boring topic and keep your attention held to the end. His passion and sense of humour help massively. My hat is firmly tipped",Andy Lintott,1
"Audio delay was not noticeable here, but it is in other videos. For example, ERB Gates vs Jobs is painfully not in sync.<br>And I&#39;d say not just &quot;relatable&quot;, but also &quot;immersive&quot; . Check &quot;I literally told you so&quot; game show where they do show the stage crew on regular occasion. So it really helps to dive into the video.",Etop Owertwon,0
"TV audio guy here-between audio and video of multiple cameras, our sync difference is within spec if it‚Äôs 2 frames or less in a 60fps environment, or about 34 milliseconds since I use that measurement to get closer. The important part, when you can, is audio be later than video for the reasons you described, but also because the speed of sound is always slower than the speed of light - you will never hear a thing before you see the thing (unless it‚Äôs out of frame), so your brain will send off alarm bells if it‚Äôs off the wrong way, but can compensate if it‚Äôs off but in the right direction.",Cody Hellyeah,2
"100ms (or ~6 frames) is actually roughly the upper limit where most people tend to notice audio and video are desynchronized, as long as you&#39;re dealing with something like talking.  This comes up a lot when building VR environments where you&#39;re trying have a central server match up audio and facial animations for a lot of clients.  Source:  former VR developer.",Brad Davis,2593
"Yes! Our brains do compensate for sound lag, such that the audio can be greatly delayed and it still looks right to us. Our brains will try to tie a sound after an action to that action.<br>The reverse is not true at all! Even a slight negative delay will be immediately noticeable. This is because it never happens in real life, and so our brains are wired to perceive a sound before an action as definitely not a part of that action.",RipleySawzen,2
I&#39;ve always felt that contrivedly doing/showing something in order to convey authenticity is itself inauthentic. Much the same way that telling someone &quot;You can trust me&quot; will often seem conspicuous and cause the opposite effect.,Jacky Lawrence,2
"Oh, are we finally getting to the arc where the production crew get introduced as characters to further drive parasocial engagement? :P<br><br>I kid of course, but it is interesting to know that video creators usually have these ideas in mind as they make their videos.",platonicVulpine,1
"This reminds me of one of the most famous Brechtian theatre techniques, in which spectators are explicitly reminded that they are in fact watching a play. Great stuff!",Luc W,2
I&#39;m thinking it can also help set baseline audio for compression and equalization of the audio waveform later.  Having a relative dB range helps with many DSP processes.,BitwiseMobile,0
"I cannot tell you how many times I have wondered why film crews use clapper boards, which of course, I&#39;ve never actually seen in person, but every time I see one in a film or documentary that uses one that is digitized, I wondered why such a manually-operated feature was still needed and now I know.  Thank you, Tom.",Grady Philpott,483
"Brilliant video, Tom. Your videos are always so informative and on point. Love it.",Vic Jang,0
"Concerning the question whether or not Tom was shooting with a crew or not, the clue is in the reflection of his eyes:<br><br>I have exported a few stills with Tom&#39;s eyes clearly showing some light reflecting in them. After raising the contrast and upscaling them with TopazLabs gigapixel, I have come to the realisation that it really doesn&#39;t matter and have started to question many choices in my life that led me to this point.<br><br>Great video, tom",Jason Oesch,7
You started talking about the trustworthiness of the creator and the things you do to make us trust you&#39;re actually on site and not using a green screen and immediately I started hearing the crickets and the truck reversing and I was 100% convinced you were going to turn off the greenscreen to prove how well those techniques worked.,Anthony Hastie,0
Tom is always answering questions I never knew I had until he posts a video üòÖ,Sweetfreeze,2
I noticed the unsynchronised audio immediately. I feel like I unconsciously look at people&#39;s lips at lot which helps but I&#39;m surprised at how little of a delay can be noticed,Joseph Hoult,0
"Same thing is huge in music. Alot of songs start with the drummer counting everyone in or even the band talking before the song, even on studio recordings. Gives it a human touch.",Marsamune,725
"i always read it as incorporating film language (since most people are probably at least familiar with film clappers) as a way of adding extra prestige, here&#39;s a lowkey version of something associated with actual professional works. this isn&#39;t just a silly vid someone put on the internet it&#39;s something made with intention and artistry which often gets dismissed bc it&#39;s a youtube vid",princessofbohemia,0
"Audio lagging behind by a couple frames typically goes unnoticed, or is not always a huge annoyance. This is because our brains are able to make sense of it by attributing the lag to distance. As light travels faster than sound, and while we&#39;re usually not aware of it, we often enough see things before we hear them in the physical world. It&#39;s clearly a wrong assumption by the brain when it comes to media, but that&#39;s fine, the false assumption allows it to cope. In fact this sort of off sync is done quite often in film for story telling purposes, we just don&#39;t notice it as something unnatural. What&#39;s more unsettling is when audio is slightly ahead of the visual as there&#39;s no way for the brain to make sense of it.",Vasim,0
"I swear, Scott could open a tin of beans and it would be an informative and engaging video that I&#39;d want to watch. üòÄ",Douglas Maxwell,1
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWYkoZKHLfg&amp;t=1m48s"">1:48</a> Yes, that&#39;s how that works, we are used to hearing sound milliseconds later than seeing whatever made that sound, and our brain automatically puts the two together. Which is why, when syncing up, and that can&#39;t be done perfectly accurate (due to one frame being 0.03 seconds long and your audio recording might not start exactly at the start of a frame), it&#39;s fine to have the sound a little bit later. But not earlier, our brain doesn&#39;t understand that.",Daedalus Young,1
People notice a delay in video compared to sound a lot easier than a delay in audio compared to video. The reason for this is that we do indeed compensate for the time it takes for sound to reach our ears. Video delay just doesn&#39;t happen in nature so it&#39;s much more noticable.,Master Cleife,0
